Services you can call from Home Assistant to set a temporary target temperature for a thermostat.

## Service: `better_thermostat.set_temp_target_temperature`

## Service: `better_thermostat.restore_saved_target_temperature`

# How can I setup a night mode schedule?

Basically you can setup a automation that triggers a service call for every climate entity.
As a example you can use this blueprint:

<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better_thermostat/blob/master/blueprints/night_mode.yaml" target="_blank"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled." /></a>

```yaml
blueprint:
  name: Better Thermostat Night mode
  description: Set BT Thermostats to night mode if Schedule event is active.
  domain: automation
  source_url: https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better_thermostat/blob/master/blueprints/night_mode.yaml
  input:
    night_times_schedule:
